	<div class="int">Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</div>

<!-- History -->  
    <div class="history"><a name="history"></a>
	<h3>1989</h3>
	<p>Tim Berners-Lee proposed global hypertext project, which became the World Wide Web</p>
    
	<h3>1993</h3>
    <p>Mosaic browser broke the mould of text-based browsers.</p>
    
    <h3>1994</h3>
    <p>The W3C created to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability." </p>
    
    <h3>1996-1999</h3>
    <p>The browser wars began. Flash was developed using basic layout and drawing tools, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h3>1998-2000</h3>
    <p>Netscape Communicator code was released under an open source licence and the Web Standards Project was formed, and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards.Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.</p>
    
    <h3>2001-2012</h3>
    <p>Many new browsers are open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The W3C has released new standards of HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's each as a new but individual standard.</p>

    <div class="tools"><a name="tools"></a>
    <h2>Tools and technologies</h2>
	<p>Technologies used for creating websites include standardised mark-up, which could be hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. There is also proprietary software based on plug-ins that bypasses the client’s browsers versions. These are often WYSIWYG but with the option of using the software’s scripting language. Search engine optimisation tools may be used to check search engine ranking and suggest improvements.</p>
</div>


<div class="occupation"><a name="occupation"></a>
	<h2>Occupations</h2>
	<p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website.</p>
    
	<p>Additional jobs include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Graphic designers</li>
		<li>Internet marketing specialists</li>
		<li>SEO writers</li>
		<li>Internet copywriter</li>
		<li>User experience (UX) designer</li>

<!-- Skills -->

<div class="grid_12">

<div class="skills"><a name="skills"></a>
	<h2>Skills and techniques</h2>

	<h3>Marketing and communication design</h3>
	<p>Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation, especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_12">
<div class="grid_5 alpha layout">    
	<h3>User experience design and interactive design</h3>
	<p>User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. If a user perceives the usefulness of that website, they are more likely to continue using it. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.</p>
    
	<p>Advanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.</p>
    </div>
<div class="grid_5 omega layout1">    
	<h3>Page layout</h3>
	<a name="page"></a>
<p>Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, a designer may consider if the sites page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout.</p>
    
	<p>Fluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and grid-based design in both page layout design principle, and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted. Responsive Web Design is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS @media pseudo-selector.</p>
</div>
</div>
	
<div class="grid_12">
<div class="grid_3 user1 alpha">    
    <h3>Typography</h3>
	<p>Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications. Most layouts on a site incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_3 user">
	<h3>Motion graphics</h3>
	<p>The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting.</p>
    </div>

<div class="grid_3 user1 omega">
	<h3>Quality of code</h3>
	<p>Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately.</p>
